**Coloured Roles:** Coloured team roles are self-assigned by choosing the teams you want to join by reacting to the message by the Formula One bot below! If this doesn’t work, please contact us via the contact us section below.

**Flairs:** Driver flairs are self-assigned by using `$flair (TextWithNoParenthesis)` in #commands. Please use this responsibly and appropriately in compliance with the rules and guidelines outlined in the #rules.

We want to reward the community for their healthy engagement in the server:

XP is gained by messaging in participating channels (#f1-general, #f1-serious, #f1-technical).

XP is given once per minute; regardless of the message count during that period.

You will unlock permissions and perks upon reaching the levels below:
‣ **Level 10**       'F4' role - Embedding perms,
‣ **Level 15**       'F3' role - File upload perms, and $news perms
‣ **Level 25**       'F2' role - Reactions perms,
‣ **Level 40**       'F1' role - Nickname perms and access to #paddock-club. (XP will no longer be granted).

A limit on XP gain (**NoXP**) may be applied for reasons such as, but not limited to the following: **Repeated off-topic messages**, **content-spam** (emojis, images, GIFs, and messages), **repeated/disruptive messages deemed low-quality**, **XP-farming through automated means** or an **extensive history of rule infringement**.

• This is done with the command syntax: `$news <URL>`
• Please ensure that your submission isn't already in the #news channel.
• Do not submit content from YouTube, The Telegraph, or the following banned websites: <https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/banned-sites>
