To ensure a safe environment with intelligent discussions in our community, we've made these rules and guidelines so that the community can have an enjoyable experience and so that we can maintain our obligations for safety as a Discord Partner.

Please note that moderators **reserve the right to act reasonably beyond the scope of these rules and guidelines to ensure fair and safe discourse,** as we can not exhaust all possible scenarios deemed disruptive or damaging.

1. **Adhere to the Discord community guidelines:** You must adhere to the Discord Community Guidelines and Terms of Service on this server, provided below:
<https://discord.com/guidelines> and <https://discord.com/terms>

2. **Do not try to circumvent moderation action:** We emphasize to users that avoiding moderation action, such as leaving and re-joining the server, is not permitted as it violates the Discord Terms/Community Guidelines and will result in a **non-negotiable ban**.

3. **Illegal, harmful and NSFW/NSFL content is prohibited:** This includes sharing illegal content that violates laws such as copyright.

4. **Do not send low-quality messages:** Spam, such as overuse of 'CAPS' and emojis is prohibited. Don't send multiple messages in a row, write your whole message, then send.

5. **Be respectful and act in good faith:** Excessive or unprovoked use of explicit, obscene, racist or vulgar language is prohibited. It is expected that members refrain from excessive non-dialogue messaging, trolling, disruptive, negative or toxic behaviour. Specifically:

    5.1 - **Do not wish or suggest threats/misfortune** on competitors (through crashing, technical issues, involvement in an incident/accident etc.),

    5.2 - **Do not excessively rant** about the race being boring,

    5.3 - **Harassment or flaming** of other users or communities (such as fanbases, drivers, teams, etc.) is prohibited.

6. **Do not enforce these rules on behalf of a moderator:** (AKA 'backseat-moderating'). Notify a moderator for appropriate and legitimate circumstances. See the contact section for more information.

7. **Do not self-promote content:** Unsolicited advertisements of all forms without permission are prohibited, and *may* lead to a **non-negotiable ban**.

8. **Agree to disagree:** Users are expected to respect the rules, guidelines & server moderators’ instructions. Note that "It's just a joke" is not a valid reason to break the rules, do not take it personally or be argumentative.

9. **Rules for usernames:** Usernames must be appropriate and @taggable.

10. **Use relevant channels:** Where possible, use and follow the rules in appropriate channels for the subject matter - **clarified by the topic and pinned messages of the channel.**

11. **Read the pinned messages in each channel:** Where required, follow the instructions of any pinned messages

• Be respectful.

• Keep all discussions in English, we are unable to effectively enforce our safety standards for messages that are not in English.

• We encourage everyone to participate in creating a community that engages in critical thinking. Please acknowledge when you believe that someone has flaws in their reasoning. We would also like to reduce the presence of cognitive biases and logical fallacies as much as possible.

• Mention @users with a purpose. Only mention another user when it is necessary.

Moderation will be applied and escalated for every infringement of the above rules and guidelines.

When a member receives a warning, the severity of the punishment remains for a __**30-day** probationary period__. Additional escalations increase the severity of the punishment as following:

‣ **1st warning:**       Warning
‣ **2nd warning:**       1-hour Mute
‣ **3rd warning:**       24-hour Mute
‣ **4th warning:**      10-day ban
‣ **5th warning:**       30-day ban

As appropriate, moderators may manually override and further escalate these punishments at their discretion (such as during a live event or during a period of higher server activity).

In addition to this, depending on the context and quality of your messages, you may be '**banished**' from opt-in channels such as #f1-serious.
